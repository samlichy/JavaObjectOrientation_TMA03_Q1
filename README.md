The Open University M250 Java Object Orientation module takes an ‘objects first’ approach to teaching; you start seeing and interacting with graphical objects right from the very start. This is achieved by working within innovative and engaging micro worlds that allow you to learn basic object-oriented principles. Throughout the module I used BlueJ, an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically developed for teaching and learning object-oriented programming. 

In the first part of the module I interacted with micro-worlds of graphical objects to explore basic object-oriented ideas. Basic object-oriented concepts such as attribute, state, protocol, class and subclass were introduced, initially through interaction with the micro world, and then in the context of writing Java code. I was expected to write short methods (the smallest units of code in Java) to specification.

The module continued the teaching about fundamental object-oriented ideas by investigating:

- Inheritance hierarchies
- Overriding methods
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Polymorphism
- Re-use of code
- Static methods and variables.

Along the way, I learnt about creating my own classes, about the facilities of Java for selection and iteration, and more about some of the core, provided Java classes. Different kinds of errors were discussed together with techniques for error handling, program design and debugging. After discussion of the need to design code, I was expected to be able to implement to specification a class along with its methods.

I was then introduced to a subset of the Java collection classes, and related issues such as ordering and sorting. I was guided to apply the knowledge I gained from the first parts of the module, along with the new classes being introduced, to increasingly complex programming exercises. The skill of appropriately utilising a provided library of classes (searching for a useful class and method, for example) was explicitly developed in this context, and re-use by composition was discussed.

The last part of the module began by investigating how data is written to and from files in Java and how objects can be made persistent by writing them to file. Both of these techniques were useful in larger scale programs.
